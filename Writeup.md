# Abstract

The goal of this project is to perform Natural Language Processing NLP in Movies dataset to build a recommendation system by using Unsupervised learning models.

# Design

We use this data to bulid a recommendation system model to use what user input to build the recommendations system by Content-based filtering. 

# Data

The dataset features include show_id, type, title, director, cast, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in and description.

- Raws: 8808 
- Columns: 12 

# Algorithms

- NLP
- Cosine Similarity

# Tools
 
- Python Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
- sklearn for machine learning

# Communication

After testing our model this figuer shows how we got a perfct recommendation system.
